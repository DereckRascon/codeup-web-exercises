    <br>

    <dd class="invisible">Summer temperatures on the South Rim are relatively pleasant (50°s - 80°s F; 10°s to high 20°s C) but inner canyon temperatures are extreme. Daytime highs at the river, 5000 feet below the rim, often exceed 100° F (38° C). Winter conditions at the South Rim can be extreme: expect snow, icy roads, and possible road closures. Temperatures are low, and with the wind-chill factor can at times drop below 0° F (-18° C).</dd>

    <br>
    <dt>Where can I camp in the Grand Canyon?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">There are several developed campgrounds in Grand Canyon National Park. Advanced reservations can be made for Mather Campground on the South Rim (open all year), and North Rim Campground (a short season May 15 through October 31).

    <br>
    <dt>When does the North Rim close?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Because winter weather occurs earlier at the North Rim, it has a short season. Lodging, restaurants and shops are open May 15 through Oct. 15, 2016 each year. Even though it is not possible to drive vehicles to the North Rim during the winter, hikers, snowshoers and cross country skiers are able to enter the North Rim of the park through the winter months, provided backcountry permits have been obtained. Personal snowmobiles are not permitted inside the park. The North Rim reopens on May 15 of every year.</dd>
